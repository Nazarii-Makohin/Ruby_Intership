# You are given the following two guidelines to begin with:
# (1) A vaulter with a height of 1.52 meters should start at 9.45 meters on the runway.
# (2) A vaulter with a height of 1.83 meters should start at 10.67 meters on the runway.
#
#
# You will receive a vaulter's height in meters
# (which will always lie in a range between a minimum of 1.22 meters and a maximum of 2.13 meters).
# Your job is to return the best starting mark in meters, rounded to two decimal places.
