#Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.
#
# The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.
#
# If begin value is greater than the end, function should returns 0
#
# Examples
#
# sequenceSum(2,2,2) === 2
# sequenceSum(2,6,2) === 12 // 2 + 4 + 6
# sequenceSum(1,5,1) === 15 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
# sequenceSum(1,5,3) === 5 // 1 + 4
